Question 19 Answers Marks
```
**a** (^) As the magnet gets closer to the top of the coil the magnetic field at the coil
increases✓
Hence the magnetic flux though the coil increases✓

### By Faraday’s law, a changing flux induces an emf✓

#### 3

**b i** From C to D the magnet is moving faster than from A to B✓

```
Hence the rate of change of flux, and therefore emf, is higher✓
```
#### 2

**b ii** Since the magnet moves faster it takes less time to move past the magnet✓ **1**

**c i**
The graph is a graph of emf versus time i.e.
_t_

versus time✓

### So, the area is the change in flux✓

#### 2

**c ii** (^) The area from A to B is the change in flux from when the magnetic is very far
away until it is essentially in the middle of the coil✓
The area from C to D is the exact opposite and so the areas are the same (in
magnitude) ✓
